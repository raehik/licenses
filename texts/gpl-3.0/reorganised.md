James C from [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) had this to say about
the GPLv3 over [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/805387/what-do-licenses-mean-gpl-mit-cc-etc):

    The GPL v3 is a spaghetti licence. Here's my attempt to reorganise it. (The
    numbers in square brackets refer to the original numbers for sections, and
    in some cases paragraphs and sentences. These are all numbered according to
    the GPL convention of 0 meaning first, so, e.g. 10p0s0 means section 10,
    paragraph 0, sentence 0, or in other words the first sentence of the first
    paragraph of section 10.)

    Definitions. [0, 1]
